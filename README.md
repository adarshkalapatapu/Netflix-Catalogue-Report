**Netflix Catalogue Report**

A comprehensive data dashboard to explore and visualize Netflix’s global content catalogue. The analysis includes content types (Movies vs TV Shows), genre distribution, top contributing countries, and yearly trends.

**Insights**

1. Movies dominate the content, but TV shows have increased in recent years.
2. Genres like Drama, Comedies, and Documentaries frequently appear. These are core offerings for Netflix and suggest areas of continued viewer interest.
3. A significant amount of content originates from the US, but there is also diversity in international content (India, UK, South Korea, etc.).
4. A sharp rise in the number of titles added after 2015, showing Netflix's content expansion phase.

**Recommendations:**

1. Double down on genre diversification in international markets.
2. Consider investing more in emerging markets with growing content consumption (like Korean dramas).
3. Use gaps in genre or country combinations to explore niche content production.

**Business Impact:** This project helps stakeholders understand Netflix’s content focus, growth patterns, and regional strategies for content acquisition and production. It was built for strategic planning, content diversification, and market analysis.
